# Conda Ansible Module

Manage [conda][] installations of Python packages in [Ansible][] playbooks.
Put this module somewhere Ansible will find it
(like the `library/` directory next to your top level playbooks).
Usage is much like the built-in Ansible pip module.
This requires `conda` to already be installed somehow.

Examples:

```yaml
- name: install numpy via conda
  conda: name=numpy state=latest

- name: install scipy 0.14 via conda
  conda: name=scipy version="0.14"

- name: remove matplotlib from conda
  conda: name=matplotlib state=absent
```

From `ansible-doc`:

```
> CONDA

  Manage Python libraries via conda. Can install, update, and remove
  packages.

Options (= is mandatory):

- channels
        Extra channels to use when installing packages [Default: None]

        Full path to the conda executable [Default: None]

- extra_args
        Extra arguments passed to conda [Default: None]
